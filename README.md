A Python matplotlib graph using CSV file.

Collection Phase

Downloaded CSV from https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/counties-detail.html.

Data Prep / Cleaning

No missing data

Modeling/Algorithms

Used the plotting library matplotlib for python to upload a CSV file and then created a bar graph out of the data. The graphs shows the population of each county in Louisiana.
